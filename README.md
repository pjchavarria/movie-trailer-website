Movies Project
=========

Website generated with python code, uses media.py (where we define our model), fresh_tomatoes.py (script that generates the html and js) and entertainment_center.py (that uses both previous files, creates classes using media.py model and runs open_movies_page() that recieves an array of anime)

###How to run:

- Run entertainment_center.py via IDLE or console.
- You're done! (open the generated fresh_tomatoes.html to see the result)
