Movies Project
=========

Website generated with python code, files: 
- media.py, where we define our model
- fresh_tomatoes.py, script that generates the html and js
- entertainment_center.py, that uses both previous files, creates classes using media.py model and runs open_movies_page() that receives an array of media objects

###How to run:

- Run entertainment_center.py via IDLE or console.
- You're done! Open the generated fresh_tomatoes.html to see the result
